This means the repository owner did not provide a description of the SCAPS contents in the README. The text doesn’t explain anything about the SCAPS files themselves.

### 2. **Typical SCAPS Folder Contents**

Though the specific SCAPS folder in this repository isn’t described in detail, a typical SCAPS directory might contain:

#### 🗂 **`.scaps` Simulation Files**
These files define:

* **Layer structure** (e.g., absorber layer, buffer layer, contact layers)
* **Material properties** (band gap, dielectric constant, mobility)
* **Defect densities**
* **Interface properties**  
These are used by SCAPS to simulate solar cell performance.

#### 📊 **Result Outputs**
When SCAPS runs a simulation, it generates:

* **I‑V curve data**
* **Quantum efficiency plots**
* **Capacitance vs voltage**  
These help evaluate solar cell performance.

#### 🧪 **Scripts (maybe Python / Batch)**
Researchers often write scripts to:

* Run multiple simulations by varying parameters like thickness, doping, or defect values.
* Automate result extraction and visualization.

#### 📑 **Documentation or Notes (if present)**
Some projects include text files explaining:

* How to run the simulations
* Which parameters were tested
* Conclusions drawn from the results

## 🔧 How to Use SCAPS‑1D

1. Download SCAPS‑1D from the official website.
2. Open `.scaps` input files to modify solar cell configurations.
3. Run simulations based on these inputs to get results like I-V curves and efficiency.
4. Analyze results using graphical output files or generated data tables.
