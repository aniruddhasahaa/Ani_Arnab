## 🔍 Core Description

* **One‑dimensional simulation program**: SCAPS‑1D models solar cells along a single dimension (through the thickness of the device), tracking how charge carriers behave across layers. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  
* **Developed at the University of Gent (Belgium)**: Created by researchers including Alex Niemegeers, Marc Burgelman, Koen Decock, Stefaan Degrave, and Johan Verschraegen. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
* **Originally for thin‑film cells**: Designed for CuInSe₂ and CdTe‑based devices but now also applicable to crystalline (e.g., Si, GaAs) and amorphous solar cells. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
* **Free for research use**: Available to the PV research community under specific academic use conditions. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## 🧠 What SCAPS‑1D Does

SCAPS‑1D simulates how a solar cell performs under illumination and electrical bias by numerically solving semiconductor equations (Poisson’s and carrier continuity equations).

### 📈 Performance Outputs

* **I‑V (current–voltage) curves**
* **Open‑circuit voltage (Voc)**
* **Short‑circuit current density (Jsc)**
* **Fill factor (FF)**
* **Power conversion efficiency (PCE)**  
These are all key parameters in evaluating solar cell performance.

### 🧪 Device Physics Analysis

It can also generate:

* **Energy band diagrams**
* **Quantum efficiency spectra**
* **Carrier recombination rates**
* **Capacitance–voltage behavior (hence “capacitance simulator”)**
